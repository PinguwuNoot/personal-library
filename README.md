# Personal Library

The application that I will be creating is a basic library application that saves and stores a collection of books. This application will be useful to anyone that enjoys reading and anyone that would benefit from being able to organize their current list of books. 

**Main Features**

* Add attributes to each book such as
  * Title
  * Author
  * Genre
  * \# of Pages
  * Published date
  * Rating /10
* Create custom series of books
* Sort and filter library

I came up with the idea for this project because I have a list of books that I read myself, but I am organizing them
 all in a note-taking app which isn't the most ideal place. There doesn't seem to be a great deal of applications like this already, so I thought it would be a fun idea to try.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to view my library (list of books)
* As a user, I want to be able to add a book to my library
* As a user, I want to be able to remove a book from my library
* As a user, I want to be able to indicate that I have or have not read a book
* As a user, I want to be able to see the list of books that I have read and a list of books that I have not read
